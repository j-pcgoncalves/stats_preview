## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size


### Links

- Live Site URL: [Stats Preview Card](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive Web Design for mobile

### What I learned

In this project i managed to further my knowledge in HTML and CSS, especially CSS Flexbox and how to use it better in a Web Page. It is a simple project, but it helped me to better understand and work with the <div> tag and the ability to create boxes and containers with said tag. It also made me understand better the different size units and when and how to use them.


### Continued development

In my future projects, i will be focusing especially in the @media queries and how i can create a good responsive Web Site for mobile and i will be using the best size unit in any given situation, so that the Website is as responsive as possible, no matter the width of the device.
